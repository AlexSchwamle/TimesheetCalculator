# TimesheetCalculator
Helps me calculate the hours I work into formatted hours, minutes, and totals.

Usage: Either run ``startProgram.bat`` or run ``main.py``, then type all of the shifts you worked in the format ``hh:mm -> hh:mm``. Once you're done entering each shift, press enter again.

``:`` and ``>`` are interchangable with ``;`` and ``.`` due to a faulty keyboard.

``startProgram.bat`` re-runs the program after you end it.

Note that this only works with hours 0 -> 12, it is not compatible with 24h.
